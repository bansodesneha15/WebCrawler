# Focused WebCrawler
The web crawler takes the query from the user and processes it and then displays the extracted links on the html page of our crawler. It crawls through the Seed URL and extracts the hyperlinks containing our query as specified in the focused crawling algorithm.
Once the links are extracted they are stored in the system database for the particular session. It does the crawling in a efficient way i.e., in a considerate amount of time.
